I am a PhD student at Bar-Ilan University, under the supervision of [Prof. Gideon Amir](https://u.math.biu.ac.il/~amirgi/) and [Prof. Uzi Vishne](https://u.math.biu.ac.il/~vishneu/).

My research interests lie in probabilistic and geometric group theory, and in particular the asymptotic behavior of random walks on finitely generated groups, word maps, and geometric properties of groups. I am also interested in stability of equations in groups and algebras.

My CV can be found [here](CV.pdf).
