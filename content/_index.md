I am a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute of Science, under the mentorship of [Prof. Gady Kozma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gady_Kozma).

Previously, I was a PhD student at Bar-Ilan University, under the supervision of [Prof. Gideon Amir](https://u.math.biu.ac.il/~amirgi/) and [Prof. Uzi Vishne](https://u.math.biu.ac.il/~vishneu/).

My research interests lie in probabilistic and geometric group theory, and in particular the asymptotic behavior of random walks on finitely generated groups, word maps, and geometric properties of groups. I am also interested in stability of equations in groups and algebras.

My CV can be found [here](CV.pdf).
